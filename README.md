This repository demonstrates a common error in Solidity: underflow/overflow errors. The `bug.sol` file contains a vulnerable `transfer` function that doesn't handle underflow cases. The `bugSolution.sol` file provides a corrected version using SafeMath library.  Underflow errors can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities, so it's important to always use SafeMath or similar methods to prevent them.
